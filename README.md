# Clevent

Clevent is an Android application developed for a Undergraduate Research that uses NFC technology to create a prepaid system that stores credits in NFC tags in NDEF format.
This project was presented at the 28th edition of SIICUSP (University of SÃ£o Paulo's International Symposium of Undergraduate Research) in November 2020.

This application encrypts and stores the balance and a history of consumed items using the NDEF format allowing operations such as balance recharging, issuing receipts, and purchasing products entirely offline, without needing a constant connection to a remote server.

## Application technical stack

The application was developed using modern Android development techniques, including:

- Jetpack Compose;
- Multi-module architecture;
- Dagger Hilt;
- Retrofit;
- Room;
- WorkManager;

## Data serialization

NFC tags have a very limited space to store data, so it's important to serialize the data efficiently to optimize space usage.

The serialization generates a byte array that can be divided into three segments:

- **Segment 1 (4 bytes):** Balance as an integer value.
- **Segment 2 (3 bytes per item):** List of items. Each item uses 3 bytes, 2 for ID and 1 for quantity.
- **Segment 3 (4 bytes):** CRC as an integer value.

The byte array resulting from serialization is then encrypted and stored on the NFC tag in NDEF format.
